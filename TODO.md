# TODO

- [ ] Finish setting up Jekyll (initially wanted to do this just so my lil emojis would render);
    Some parts to this:
    - [ ] Figure out whether to, and if so, set up, my site to [view changes locally? or just set it up locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#keeping-your-site-up-to-date-with-the-github-pages-gem)
        NOTE: I think this means to be able to view the site locally, this *isn't* just the steps to set up the site to use jekyll *at all*.
    - [ ] Figure out how this interacts with [GitHub Pages themes](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser)
        NOTE: I don't think it says this in the theme chooser, but the themes are *jekyll* themes.
